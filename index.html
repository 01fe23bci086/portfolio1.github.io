        <h2>üìñ Reflection on Learning Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Throughout this course, I delved deep into fundamental data structures and algorithms, which are the backbone of efficient computing. Key topics I explored include <strong>Time Complexity Analysis</strong>, <strong>Binary Search Trees (BST)</strong>, <strong>DFS and BFS</strong>, <strong>Heap Sorting</strong>, <strong>Pattern Searching</strong>, and <strong>Graph Algorithms</strong>. Here's a reflection on what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I approached solving complex problems.</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts Learned</h3>
        <h4>1. Time Complexity Analysis</h4>
        <p>Time complexity analysis is essential for determining the efficiency of algorithms. By mastering <strong>Big-O notation</strong>, I learned how to evaluate the performance of algorithms, especially for large input sizes. The ability to analyze an algorithm's <strong>best, worst, and average-case</strong> complexities helps select the optimal approach for solving problems.</p>

        <h4>2. Binary Search Tree (BST)</h4>
        <p>I gained a strong understanding of how <strong>BSTs</strong> allow efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations in logarithmic time. The main challenge was mastering tree traversal methods, both iterative and recursive, and understanding the importance of maintaining balance in the tree to ensure performance remains optimal.</p>

        <h4>3. DFS and BFS</h4>
        <p><strong>DFS</strong> is useful for exploring paths deeply, while <strong>BFS</strong> is efficient for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. I implemented both in various graph scenarios, such as finding connected components or shortest paths.</p>

        <h4>4. Heap Sorting</h4>
        <p><strong>Heap Sort</strong> introduced me to the importance of the heap data structure. I learned how the binary heap allows us to efficiently retrieve the smallest or largest element and perform sorting in <strong>O(n log n)</strong> time. The challenge was understanding how the heap property is maintained during insertions and deletions.</p>

        <h4>5. Pattern Searching</h4>
        <p>I explored various algorithms for <strong>Pattern Searching</strong>, such as <strong>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)</strong>, which is highly efficient for finding substrings in a larger string. These algorithms optimize the brute-force approach by reducing unnecessary comparisons.</p>

        <h4>6. Graph Algorithms</h4>
        <p>I learned the importance of <strong>graphs</strong> in representing real-world relationships, such as social networks and transportation systems. Key algorithms like <strong>Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm</strong> for shortest path finding and <strong>Prim‚Äôs Algorithm</strong> for minimum spanning trees helped me understand the complexities involved in graph-based problems.</p>

    <section class="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges in Learning and Understanding</h2>
        <p>Grasping the concepts of Time Complexity, DFS/BFS, and Pattern Searching required patience and practice, as well as understanding the underlying recursive nature of many algorithms. Heap Sort and Graph Algorithms were also difficult to implement initially due to their complexity and optimization techniques.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="real-world">
        <h2>Challenges in Relating to Real-World Applications</h2>
        <p>Time Complexity is theoretical, and applying it to real-world systems can sometimes be inaccurate due to factors like input size and hardware limitations. For algorithms like Graph Traversal and Heap Sorting, the scale of data in real-world applications requires additional optimizations to manage performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="approach">
        <h2>Approach to Solving Complex Problems</h2>
        <p>When solving complex problems, I analyze the problem, select the most appropriate algorithm based on time complexity, and continuously optimize the solution. Testing edge cases ensures robustness, and real-world benchmarking validates the performance of the solution.</p>
