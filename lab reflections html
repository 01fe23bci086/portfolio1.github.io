        <section class="intro">
            <p>Throughout this course, I delved deep into fundamental data structures and algorithms, which are the backbone of efficient computing. Key topics I explored include <strong>Time Complexity Analysis</strong>, <strong>Binary Search Trees (BST)</strong>, <strong>DFS and BFS</strong>, <strong>Heap Sorting</strong>, <strong>Pattern Searching</strong>, and <strong>Graph Algorithms</strong>. Here's a reflection on what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I approached solving complex problems.</p>
